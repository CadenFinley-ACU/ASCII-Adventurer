User testing
**Users overall thoughts:**
	The main things that the users have been saying is that they keep getting lost in the open world. 
  This is because there is no map that is always up and so the users keep forgetting where they came from. 

**Something that stuck out to the users:**
	Something that the users really liked was that the health pops out so much, 
  this is because at times when they were in a dungeon, they would forget to look up at what their health was. 
  Something else was how there is an order to the dungeon. The users said that it brings them into the story and starts looking at what the text is saying. 
  Finally there was how the text on the screen, using the colors really helped with what is going on. 

**Something that the users didn’t like:**
	Something that the users really didn’t like about the game was how unconstant the damage was from the things that you are fighting. 
  This is because they thought that they were prepared for the next thing and still ended up dying from whatever happened anyway. 
	
**Would you want to play the game again**
	Most users said that they would play the game again even though they died within the first part of the game. 
  The users really liked what was going on even though they died at the start of the game.
