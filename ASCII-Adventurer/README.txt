Welcome to our SE1 F24 ACU final project!

To run our game is super simple double click either one of the shortcuts provided in the directory to get started!

If you are ever stuck in the game not knowing what to do you can always type, "help"

Have fun!

Any and all feedback is appreciated: cjf22d@acu.edu
